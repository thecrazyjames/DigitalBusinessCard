        <p>I like to say that I <em>USED</em> to be a Civil Engineer. I love technology and left the dirt and local government behind me to pursue what I love, working with Computers!</p>
        
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and staying physically fit. Basketball is my favorite sport! I also enjoy going out to dinner and eating really tasty food.</p>
