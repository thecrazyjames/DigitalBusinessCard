        <p>I like to say that I <em>USED</em> to be a Civil Engineer. I love technology and left the dirt and local government behind me to pursue what I love, working with Computers!</p>
        
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>Things I am interested in are spending time with my family and staying physically fit. I also enjoy going on to dinner for really tasty food.</p>
